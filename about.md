Hi, I'm deemkeen.

This is my personal blog where I write..no no, not me, the LLM mostly does, we are living in the future, right? 
So yeah, *we write* about automation, problem-solving, and the inevitable new problems that arise from solving the old ones.

If you're interested in learning how to make your life easier (and more complicated at the same time), you're in the right place.
